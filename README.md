# Hi there üëã

Hello, I‚Äôm **Oskar** - an experienced programmer, cybersecurity enthusiast, and conference speaker. 

## What do I do professionally üßë‚Äçüíª
I am **founder** and proud **CTO** of **[AT Cloud](https://www.atcloud.pro)** software agency, that provides cloud computing services and data processing platform for local B2B clients in Poland.

On every day I'm **Senior Software Engineering Consultant** in **[Digital New Agency](https://dnatechnology.io/)**, we're providing specialized consulting regarding fin-tech product development, maintenance services and internal product support.

After hours I'm proud volounteer and board member at non-government organization **[Fundacja Generacja Innowacja](https://gi.org.pl)**. In my role of **Technical Leader** I am responsible for coordinating volounteer-based dev teams with our social goals. I organize internship programs, manage backlog and development flow within the organization.
My previous workplaces and other experience can be reviewed at my **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oskarbarcz/)** profile.

My portfolio is full of fascinating products and challenges - I‚Äôm known for bringing a new, fresh perspective and energy to the team and I deliver high-quality solutions fitting business needs.
I‚Äôm not afraid of new challenges and continuous development - it‚Äôs just the daily part of our job. I get used to building up products using lean startup methods and in data-driven environments - however, I‚Äôm open to meeting new standards and approaches as long as they allow me to fulfill business needs more clearly.
