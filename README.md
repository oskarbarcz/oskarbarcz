# Hi there üëã

Hello, I‚Äôm __Oskar__ - an experienced programmer, cybersecurity enthusiast, and conference speaker. 

## What do I do professionally
I am **founder** and proud **CTO** of **[AT Cloud](https://www.atcloud.pro)** software agency, that provides B2B cloud computing and data processing services based on shared modules. 

On every day I'm **Senior Software Engineer** in **[PiwikPRO](https://piwik.pro)**, we're providing a leading privacy-first analytics platform for marketers and analysts that lets you respect user privacy every step of the way.

My portfolio is full of fascinating products and challenges - I‚Äôm known for bringing a new, fresh perspective and energy to the team and I deliver high-quality solutions fitting business needs.
I‚Äôm not afraid of new challenges and continuous development - it‚Äôs just the daily part of our job. I get used to building up products using lean startup methods and in data-driven environments - however, I‚Äôm open to meeting new standards and approaches as long as they allow me to fulfill business needs more clearly.

## What do I do on my freetime
On the private site, I‚Äôm a huge aviation enthusiast, flying often on the VATSIM network. I‚Äôm also interested in urban planning and modern architecture. Yet my favorite game is Cities Skylines and Microsoft Flight Simulator. I‚Äôm also a typical cat person - having three sweet cuties.
