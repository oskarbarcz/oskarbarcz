### Hi there 👋

Hello, I’m __Oskar__ - an experienced programmer, technology enthusiast, and conference speaker. Despite my young age, my portfolio is full of fascinating products and challenges - I’m known for bringing a new, fresh perspective and energy to the team.

I’m not afraid of new challenges and continuous development - it’s just the daily part of our job. I get used to building up products using lean startup methods and in data-driven environments - however, I’m open to meeting new standards and approaches.

On the private site, I’m a huge aviation enthusiast, I’m taking the course for private pilot license PPL(A). I’m also interested in urban planning, architecture, and city planning. Yet my favorite game is Cities Skylines. I’m also a typical cat person - having three sweet cuties.
